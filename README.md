forkbomb
========

Simpliest one liner fork bomb for Linux/Unix written in C++.

For clearer code the source was rewritten in ANSI C++ style. But I think the
one liner version is pretty understandable.

This code has one drawback - you can press ctrl-c and end the program, and then
the OS gets back to its normal cpu load.
If you have got an idea to improve the forkbomb app - please send me a pull
request.

best regards,
